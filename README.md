## Make Change Project 

### Skill Distillery Week 1 Homework

Program to calculate change.

#### Project Description

User can enter a product price and amount of money provided to cashier.
* If amount provided is not enough, system will show an error and amount owed.
* If amount provided is exact change, app will say "Thank you" and end
* If amount is more than needed, app will calculate change and provide the amount of bills and coins owed to the customer.

Technologies used:
* Java
* Git
* Github


#### Lessons Learned

* need to recalculate the change amount as part of the loop
* using doubles and dividing by amount lost would lose the values < 1
* remember to clean up code and comments
* can use a string array to perform the same calcs on multiple values for cleaner code
* think about business logic. Ex: customer/cashier interaction can be completely separate from money calculations
